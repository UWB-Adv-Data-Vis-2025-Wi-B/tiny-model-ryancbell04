```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library('tidyverse') ; library('modeldata')

```

## Introduction

This R Markdown shows my abilities to use models for data analysis using data set collected on crickets.


```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
