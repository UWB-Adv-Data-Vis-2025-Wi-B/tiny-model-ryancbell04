## Introduction

This R Markdown shows my abilities to use models for data analysis using data set collected on crickets.


```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```

## What is that sound?

In this report, we examine what factors predict a cricket's chirp rate.


```{r summary, echo = FALSE}
summary(crickets)
``` 


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
